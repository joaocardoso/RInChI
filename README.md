# RInChI
[RInChI](http://www-rinchi.ch.cam.ac.uk/) Extended Toolkit

The aim of the RInChI project, in the same vein as InChI, is to create a unique data string to describe a reaction. Reaction InChIs, or RInChIs, are such data strings. They use the InChI software and from an rxn input file a RInChI can be created. The tools for doing this are below, and some helpful information is given in the help pages.
